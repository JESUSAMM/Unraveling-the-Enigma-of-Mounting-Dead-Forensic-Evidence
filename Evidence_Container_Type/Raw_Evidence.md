# Raw Evidence

## Overview
Raw evidence, often referred to as a raw disk image, is a fundamental form of evidence in digital forensics. It represents a bit-by-bit copy of a storage device, capturing all data, including the file system structure, unallocated space, and metadata. Raw evidence is considered the most unaltered representation of the original storage medium, making it valuable for forensic analysis.

## Characteristics

- Raw evidence is a complete and exact copy of the source device, making it forensically sound and ideal for preservation.
- It includes both used and unused space on the storage medium, providing a comprehensive view of the data.
- Raw images are typically created using tools like `dd` in Linux or `FTK Imager` in Windows.
- They do not have any compression or encryption applied, ensuring data integrity.

## Usage

- Raw evidence is crucial for investigations where data preservation and integrity are paramount.
- It serves as the basis for data recovery, file system analysis, and artifact extraction.
- Investigators use raw evidence to create a working copy for analysis, ensuring the preservation of the original evidence.

## Best Practices

- Always create raw images using forensically sound tools to maintain the integrity of the evidence.
- Document the acquisition process, including the hardware used, date, time, and individuals involved.
- Securely store raw evidence to prevent tampering or alteration.
- Verify the integrity of raw images through checksums to ensure their authenticity.

## Challenges

- Raw evidence can be large in size, requiring ample storage space.
- Processing raw images can be time-consuming, especially when dealing with extensive storage media.

## Tools for Working with Raw Evidence

- **dd (Linux)**: A command-line utility for creating bit-for-bit copies of devices.
- **FTK Imager (Windows)**: A user-friendly tool for creating forensic disk images.
