## Splitted Raw Evidence

### Overview
Splitted raw evidence, also known as segmented raw disk images, is a practice in digital forensics where a large raw disk image is divided into smaller segments. This segmentation can facilitate storage, sharing, and analysis of the evidence.

### Characteristics

- A large raw disk image is split into smaller, manageable pieces.
- Each segment typically has a specific size, making it easier to handle.
- Segmentation can be done using various tools or manual techniques.

### Usage

- Segmented raw images are useful for cases where handling a large, monolithic raw image is impractical.
- They can simplify data sharing among forensic analysts, especially when dealing with evidence across multiple locations.

### Best Practices

- Document the segmentation process, ensuring that the original image's integrity is maintained.
- Keep a record of which segments correspond to which parts of the original storage device.
- Ensure secure storage and transmission of segmented images to prevent tampering.

### Challenges

- Keeping track of segmented images and maintaining their chain of custody can be more complex than working with a single raw image.
- Care must be taken to ensure that no data is lost or altered during the segmentation process.
