## Mounting LUKS-Encrypted Drives

In the realm of digital forensics, encounters with LUKS-encrypted drives are commonplace, especially in the context of Linux systems. LUKS, standing for Linux Unified Key Setup, provides a standard format for disk encryption, offering a robust and widely adopted method to secure data at rest.

### LUKS Overview

LUKS serves as the de facto standard for disk encryption on Linux systems. It provides a flexible framework for creating, managing, and unlocking encrypted volumes. LUKS operates by encrypting entire partitions or logical volumes, adding a layer of security that safeguards sensitive information.

As we delve into the intricacies of mounting LUKS-encrypted drives, this section will guide you through the process of unlocking these encrypted volumes and gaining access to the underlying file systems. Let's unravel the mysteries of LUKS together.

### Mounting LUKS Volumes: Advanced Techniques
> **Note:** This section assumes that you are already acquainted with the fundamental steps of mounting evidence, including creating the bridge, identifying partitions, and understanding file systems. We won't reiterate these basics in the following explanations.
> **Note 2:** This example will be running with a raw image of the partition and not of the disk.

> **Note:** In this section, we won't be utilizing commands like `mmls` or `fsstat` because our evidence pertains to a specific partition, not an entire disk. These commands are designed for analyzing disk structures and file systems on complete disks. Instead, we'll focus on tools and techniques more suited for the specific file system within the partition for effective analysis.


- Step 1:
  - Run the `cryptsetup` command to decrypt the partition.
    -  `cryptsetup luksOpen <disk_img> encrypted_volume`
    -  > **Info:**    This command prompts for the LUKS passphrase or keyfile, effectively unlocking the encrypted partition.
