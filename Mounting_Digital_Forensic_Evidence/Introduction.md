In this section, you'll find a summary of the four key procedures involved in the process of mounting digital forensic evidence. Each procedure is explained in detail in its respective subdirectory.

- **Mount the Bridge:** Creating a bridge directory to access evidence containers as raw images.
- **Know the Partition Table:** Understanding the storage medium's partition structure.
- **Know the File System:** Identifying the filesystem used within the selected partition.
- **Mount the File System:** Mounting the partition's filesystem to access and analyze the data.
