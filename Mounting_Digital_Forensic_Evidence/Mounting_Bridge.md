# **Mounting Bridge: Bridging the Gap to Digital Forensic Evidence**

---

## **Introduction**

In the realm of digital forensics, the process of extracting, accessing, and analyzing evidence is both an art and a science. It's akin to solving a complex puzzle, with every piece of data forming an integral part of the larger picture. To piece this puzzle together, one of the essential components is the "Mounting Bridge."

Imagine the Mounting Bridge as a crucial gateway that allows us to seamlessly transition between different types of evidence containers and the tools and techniques we use to examine them. It serves as a crucial link in the chain, ensuring that digital forensic investigators can access the data stored within these containers accurately and securely.

### What is the Mounting Bridge?

The Mounting Bridge is essentially a directory â€“ a central hub within your digital forensics toolkit. Its purpose is to provide a standardized and structured environment where you can mount various types of evidence containers. When you mount an evidence container in this bridge, it appears as if it were a raw disk image, making it accessible for further analysis.

### Why Do We Need a Mounting Bridge?

The need for a Mounting Bridge arises from the diverse formats in which digital forensic evidence can be presented. Each evidence container, whether it's a raw disk image, a segmented raw image, or a proprietary format, requires a specific approach for access and analysis. This bridge simplifies the process by creating a uniform platform for handling these containers.

In the following sections of this directory, we will explore the step-by-step process of creating a Mounting Bridge, mounting different types of evidence containers within it, and preparing the evidence for further examination. By understanding the importance and functionality of this bridge, you will be well-equipped to embark on your digital forensic journey, bridging the gap between evidence and insight.

Welcome to the world of the Mounting Bridge, where digital forensic investigations become more accessible and structured.

### Mounting Commands for Evidence Containers

In this section, you will find a concise list of commands to mount different types of evidence containers specifically for Linux. For those working in a Linux environment, these commands are tailored to help you access and analyze evidence containers. If you are using a Windows environment, you can consider using FTK Imager, which provides similar functionality for mounting evidence containers.

Commands:

- **E01:** `ewfmount -X allow_root <evidence_path> <bridge_path>`
- **vmdk:** `vmdkmount -X allow_root <evidence_path> <bridge_path>`
- **splitted raw:** `affuse -o allow_other <evidence_path> <bridge_path>`
- **vhd:** `vhdimount -o allow_other <evidence_path> <bridge_path>`

### EXAMPLE:
  - Create a directory where to mount the container.
