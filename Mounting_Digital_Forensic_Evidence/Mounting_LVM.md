## Unraveling Logical Volumes

In the realm of storage management, Logical Volumes (LVM) introduce a layer of abstraction that offers flexibility and efficiency in handling disk space. This section explores the concept of Logical Volumes and provides insights into the techniques needed to mount evidence stored within these dynamic storage structures.

### Introduction to Logical Volumes

Logical Volumes are a key component of storage management, allowing for dynamic allocation and resizing of storage space on Linux systems. Unlike traditional partitioning, LVM provides a more flexible approach to managing disk resources, enabling features such as volume resizing, snapshots, and more.

In this section, we'll unravel the intricacies of Logical Volumes, guiding you through the process of mounting evidence stored within this versatile storage abstraction. Understanding Logical Volumes is essential for digital forensic investigators working with Linux systems, where LVM is commonly employed.

Let's embark on a journey to comprehend and effectively mount evidence within Logical Volumes.
